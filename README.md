# Music Marker
[Live demo](https://jort-dev.github.io/music_marker/)  
Record timestamps to use in my [Easy Beat Sync](https://github.com/jort-dev/easy-beat-sync) program.  
The app outputs a `timestamps.yaml` file, which looks like this:
```yaml
type1:
- 3440
- 5240
- 6892
- 8732
- ...etc
type2:
- 16704
- 16912
- ...etc
```

You can use the web client or the [Python client](/python_client).  
The web client is just a single file, [index.html](index.html). Just download and double-click it.  
The `index.html` file is also hosted on:
* [GitHub pages](https://jort-dev.github.io/music_marker/)
* [My website](https://jort.dev/music_marker)
