# Music Marker
Record timestamps to use in my [Easy Beat Sync](https://github.com/jort-dev/easy-beat-sync) program.  
You can use the [web app](/web_client) or the [Python app](/python_client).  
The documentation for them can be found in their folders.

The apps both output a `timestamps.yaml` file, which looks like this:
```yaml
type1:
- 3440
- 5240
- 6892
- 8732
- ...etc
type2:
- 16704
- 16912
- ...etc
```
