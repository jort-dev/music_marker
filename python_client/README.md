# Music Marker - Python client

Run `python music_marker.py`, select a song in the file dialog, and start marking!

First, set up a virtual environment with the instructions below.

## Setup Python environment

A virtual environment is not required, but is good practice.  
Create virtual Python environment called `venv`:

```shell
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the created environment:

```shell
. venv/bin/activate
```

Install required python packages:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
